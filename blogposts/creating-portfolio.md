## Introduction

That's self-explanatory, right? 
"Of course, planning is a crucial part of any project!" you would say   
"The first process of any project management approach is to define the scope, do a feasibility study, and plan after all." 

And you are correct. But do we really plan our actions, or do the majority of problems arise simply because someone didn't spend 10-15 minutes on planning?  
I've faced such problems in my personal projects. Let's dive into it.

## The very first blog website

My goal was to build a blog website where I could share my 'rich experience' with others, and it **had to be free**. In other words,
maintenance of it had to give me a bill of $0 
Well, you can check it out right here: [blog](https://alishersk-blog.web.app/)

No, it's not your internet connection, it's free backend hosting. Shortly, to 'get up', the server needs around 40–50 seconds.   
When I was building it, there was only "It would be really incredible to have a blog website, I can showcase my abilities like that!" in my head    
And only in the end, when it was time to host it, I realised that I screwed up. That's how this website was born, this time it's free, without significant drawbacks.

### Let's dive a little bit deeper
Once upon a time, a past version of me wondered, "How do you land a job in this market?" To which I answered myself, "Perhaps showcasing my abilities would help. Hm... Oh! Right! I'll start a blog!" Then it struck me that it would be even more impressive to use tools I wasn't familiar with. That was the deciding moment, and I chose MongoDB, Express.js (essentially an enhancement of Node.js), and React.js.
Caught up in the excitement, I completely bypassed the planning stage and dived straight into coding. If I had taken a step back and acknowledged that I was building it for users and not just for myself, I might have taken the time to check and study everything beforehand. Then, I might have realized that using the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node) was not the best idea if I wanted to keep things simple and cost-free.

That initial blog looked great, featured private admin login, and included a convenient post builder right on the website. However, no one would wait 40–50 seconds for a site to load. Rather than looking for alternative hosting options, this realization led me to develop this current website using just Next.js, fulfilling the requirements of being free and user-friendly. This blog is significantly lighter and simpler than the previous one, so much so that I plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future.

## Do not repeat mistakes
### Practical Steps for Effective Planning in Software Projects

Let's consider how we can improve the planning, keeping it simple, not too time-consuming, and effective. 

#### 1. Define Clear Objectives
Before jumping into any code, define what you want to achieve with the project. It's not just about the features, but also about the user experience, performance, and scalability. Set SMART goals - specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

#### 2. Research and Choose the Right Tools
Research is a phase that's often underestimated. Look into different technologies, their pros and cons, and their costs, including hidden ones like long-term maintenance. Sometimes a simpler stack that you know well can be more effective than a complex, cutting-edge one.

#### 3. Map Out User Stories
Think from a user's perspective. What features will they need? How will they interact with your application? Mapping out user stories can help ensure that you're building functionality that's actually useful.

#### 4. Create a Wireframe or Prototype
Visualizing your project before coding can save you countless hours of refactoring. Use tools for wireframing or prototyping to get a sense of the user interface and experience.

#### 5. Break Down the Project into Manageable Tasks
Once you have a clear idea of your project's scope, break it down into small, manageable tasks. This can help you track progress and makes the project less overwhelming.

#### 6. Time Estimation and Scheduling
Allocate time estimates for each task and set up a schedule. This will help you manage your time efficiently and set realistic deadlines.

#### 7. Set Up Version Control from the Start
It might seem basic, but setting up a repository and committing your changes right from the beginning can save you from potential disasters.

#### 8. Incorporate Testing into Your Plan
Plan for testing from the start. Whether it's unit testing, integration testing, or end-to-end testing, ensuring that each piece of your application works as expected is crucial.

#### 9. Plan for Deployment Early On
Understand deployment options and costs early in the process. This includes looking at hosting, domains, CDN usage, database storage, and any potential scaling issues.

#### 10. Include Buffer Time for Unexpected Hurdles
Things often take longer than expected. Include buffer time for unexpected issues, such as technical difficulties or changes in project requirements.

## The Payoff of Planning

The time invested in planning can seem boring and like a drag on your progress, but in the end, it pays off. You'll face fewer unexpected challenges, your project will be more aligned with your goals, and you'll ultimately save time by avoiding major revisions or rewrites.

## Conclusion
In the story of my two blogs, it's evident that a little bit of planning goes a long way. It's not just about getting the project done, but getting it done right with minimal stress and maximum efficiency. I hope that the information provided was useful to you. See you at the next one!
